                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This is a portfolio site which consists of 5 different pages namely a home page, projects page, a video demonstration page, a contact page and finally here, a site report page. The knowledge and information gained from this module over the past few weeks were used to create this website from the basics of coding and web development all the way to design and debugging process. </p>
                <h2>Design Inspiration</h2>
                <p>I’ve chosen to go for the minimalistic yet sleek design of black and green, which looks appealing to the eyes (the hex codes were obtained from a Coolors Palette Generator). Taking inspiration from my module lecturer, Chris, I embraced the grid layout which he has presented in his lectures because “if it isn’t broke, don’t fix it” right? </p>
                <h2>Module Experience</h2>
                <p> Obviously, some of the stuff in coding didn’t go as easy as I’d hoped, especially the alignment, padding and margin distance of the menu tabs, images and captions. Not to mention the trial-and-error method of getting your code right, asking for advice from my lecturer and peers and finally discovering something on your own. </p>
